# MultiHub Swap Fix Implementation

This document explains the fix for the "InvalidMint" error (Custom Program Error 11) in the MultiHub Swap program.

## Problem Overview

When executing token swaps, users were encountering the `InvalidMint` error (Custom Program Error 11), which occurs when:
- The YOS token account doesn't exist when the swap instruction is executed
- The transaction attempts to create the YOS account and perform the swap in a single transaction
- The SPL token program's account creation validation fails due to an incomplete account setup

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a two-step approach that ensures all required token accounts exist before executing a swap:

1. **Separate YOS Account Creation**: The fixed implementation creates the YOS token account in a separate transaction before attempting the swap.
2. **Multiple Verification Checks**: Added additional validation to confirm the YOS token account exists before processing the swap transaction.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Contract Implementation (`program/src/multihub_swap.rs`)

Created a separate contract implementation file that:
- Ensures the YOS token account exists and is initialized
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging
- Improves input data validation
- Maintains compatibility with existing account structures
- Keeps the same program ID to avoid deployment complexities

### 2. Improved Client Implementation (`client/src/lib/multihub-client-improved.ts`)

Created a new client implementation that:
- Creates a dedicated function `ensureYosTokenAccountExists()` to check and create the YOS token account
- Calls this function before attempting any swaps
- Adds detailed logging for better debugging
- Includes enhanced error handling for common failure scenarios

### 3. Updated UI Integration (`client/src/pages/CashbackSwapPage.tsx`)

Modified the CashbackSwapPage to:
- Import the improved implementation
- Add separate YOS token account creation step
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Maintain compatibility with the existing user interface

## How to Use the Fix

The fix is now integrated into the main application flow:

1. When a user initiates a token swap, the application first verifies the program is initialized
2. Then it explicitly creates the YOS token account in a separate transaction if needed
3. Only after confirming the YOS token account exists, it proceeds with the swap

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files

- `program/src/multihub_swap.rs`: The new contract implementation
- `client/src/lib/multihub-client-improved.ts`: The improved client-side implementation
- `client/src/pages/CashbackSwapPage.tsx`: Updated UI integration

### Cargo Configuration 

The `Cargo.toml` file was modified to:
- Keep the original library implementation
- Add a new binary target for the fixed version
- Use the same program ID for compatibility

## Verification and Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Ensure the YOS token account exists for your wallet
2. Attempt a token swap on the Cashback Swap page
3. Monitor the browser console for detailed transaction logs
4. If any issues persist, check the Solana Explorer for transaction details

## Future Improvements

Further enhancements could include:
- Adding a cache to track which wallets already have YOS accounts
- Implementing a fallback mechanism if the initial YOS account creation fails
- Improving error messages to be more user-friendly
- Adding automatic token account creation for all required tokens in a single preparation step
