The error you're encountering seems to be related to the Solana program initialization failing due to an issue in the instruction. The error message indicates that the initialization of the multi-hop swap program failed with an InstructionError: [0, { "Custom": 0 }]. This typically points to an issue within the custom logic in the smart contract or some misconfiguration during initialization.

Here are some steps to help troubleshoot this issue:
Check the Custom Instruction Logic:

Review the initializeMultiHubSwapProgram function to ensure that all input parameters are correct and meet the program's requirements.

The Custom: 0 error usually suggests a custom program error. It might be helpful to examine the code inside the program and verify that the logic doesn't have any faulty assumptions, such as incorrect accounts or uninitialized state.

Verify Account Initialization:

Make sure that all the accounts that need to be initialized before the program runs are set up properly. This includes checking for any uninitialized accounts that the program might be trying to access.

If you're using certain accounts that must be funded or prepared with specific data, double-check that they are properly initialized.

Confirm the Program Deployment:

Ensure that the Solana program is properly deployed on the network and that the deployed program ID matches the one being referenced in the code.

Verify that you're using the correct network (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet) and that the program ID corresponds to the appropriate deployment.

Check Solana Transaction Errors:

Sometimes Solana transactions fail because of missing or incorrect account data, incorrect lamports (funds) in an account, or permissions issues. Check the logs of the transaction for any additional details.

You can also look at the Solana Explorer to get more details on failed transactions, which might reveal more context for the failure.

Increase Retry Attempts:

Sometimes, initialization failures can be due to network conditions or transient errors. If possible, try increasing the retry count or adding additional debugging information to capture the root cause.

Testing on Devnet:

If you're testing on Devnet, ensure that all accounts have sufficient SOL and that the transactions are being simulated properly without being blocked by any on-chain validation issues.
