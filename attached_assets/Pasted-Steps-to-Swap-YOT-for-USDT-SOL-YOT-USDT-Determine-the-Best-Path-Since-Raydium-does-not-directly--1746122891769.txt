Steps to Swap YOT for USDT (SOL-YOT-USDT):
Determine the Best Path: Since Raydium does not directly support a YOT/USDT pair (unless specifically added), the swap will go through the intermediary token pair, in this case, SOL. This means you will perform a multi-hop swap from YOT → SOL → USDT.

Use the Raydium Router: The Raydium router (which you mentioned earlier) will be responsible for routing the trade through the liquidity pools that contain the SOL/YOT and SOL/USDT pairs.

Quote and Swap using Raydium Router: You will need to call the quote API and then use the swap instructions API to prepare and execute the swap.

Example Steps:
Step 1: Get the Quote for the Multi-Hop Swap (YOT → SOL → USDT)
You need to query Raydium to get a route for the swap. For this, you can use Jupiter’s API to calculate the swap quote for multiple hops.

Jupiter Quote API: Request a quote that will get the best path for the swap from YOT to USDT (involving the SOL token in between).

javascript
Copy
fetch('https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote?inputMint=<YOT_MINT_ADDRESS>&outputMint=<USDT_MINT_ADDRESS>&amount=<AMOUNT>&slippageBps=50')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);  // Look for a route with SOL as an intermediary
  });
In this example, replace <YOT_MINT_ADDRESS> and <USDT_MINT_ADDRESS> with the actual mint addresses of YOT and USDT respectively. The response will show you the intermediary paths, likely including SOL.

Step 2: Get Swap Instructions
Once you have the quote, you need to prepare the instructions for the swap using the swap instruction API from Jupiter:

javascript
Copy
fetch('https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/swap-instructions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    quoteResponse: data.data,  // The quote data from Step 1
    userPublicKey: '<USER_PUBLIC_KEY>'
  })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(instructions => {
    console.log(instructions);  // This will provide you with the transaction instructions
  });
Here, <USER_PUBLIC_KEY> refers to the wallet address where the swap should occur.

Step 3: Execute the Swap via the Router
After obtaining the transaction instructions from Step 2, you can send these instructions to Raydium's router contract to execute the swap.

Here’s how you might initiate the swap in the Solana network (using Solana Web3.js):

javascript
Copy
import { Connection, PublicKey, Keypair, Transaction, SystemProgram } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Set up connection and wallet
const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com', 'confirmed');
const userKeypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(<USER_SECRET_KEY>);  // Your wallet

// Raydium Router contract address (example, make sure it's correct)
const routerAddress = new PublicKey('BVChZ3XFEwTMUk1o9i3HAf91H6mFxSwa5X2wFAWhYPhU');

// Create the transaction with instructions
const tx = new Transaction().add(...instructions);

// Send the transaction to Solana
const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(tx, [userKeypair], { skipPreflight: false, preflightCommitment: 'confirmed' });
console.log('Transaction signature:', signature);
Router Address: You would use the correct router address for Raydium.

Instructions: These instructions come from the swap instruction API in Step 2.

Step 4: Monitor the Transaction
Once the transaction is sent, you can monitor its status to check whether the swap was successful.

Summary
Use Jupiter's quote API to get the best swap path (YOT → SOL → USDT).

Use the swap-instructions API to prepare the transaction instructions.

Send the transaction via the Raydium router smart contract to execute the swap.

Monitor the transaction for success.
