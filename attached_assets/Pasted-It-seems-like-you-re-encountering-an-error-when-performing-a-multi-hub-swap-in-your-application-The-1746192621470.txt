It seems like you're encountering an error when performing a multi-hub swap in your application. The error, WalletSendTransactionError: Unexpected error, is coming from the executeFixedMultiHubSwap function, which suggests something is failing in the process of sending a transaction through the wallet.

Here are a few things you could check or do to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Transaction Parameters
Ensure that the parameters you are sending with the transaction are correct (e.g., token amounts, token addresses, user wallet address, etc.).

Check if the token accounts for the source and destination tokens are properly initialized and associated with the user's wallet.

2. Transaction Signature
Verify that the wallet is properly signed into the application and that the correct signature is being provided for the transaction.

Check if the wallet provider (e.g., Phantom, Sollet, etc.) is functioning correctly, and if any issues are reported in their API or error handling logs.

3. Network or RPC Issues
Confirm that the RPC node you're connecting to is not having any issues, like high latency or downtime. If you're using a custom RPC, try switching to a different one to see if the issue persists.

Ensure that the transaction is being sent to the correct network (Devnet, Testnet, or Mainnet) based on your environment setup.

4. Transaction Fee
Ensure that the user's wallet has enough SOL to cover the transaction fees. A transaction failure may also occur if the user doesn't have sufficient balance for fees.

5. Debugging Steps:
Console Logs: Add more detailed logging around the transaction creation and execution steps. This will allow you to track the parameters being passed and see if there are any issues before the transaction is sent.

Transaction Simulation: Try simulating the transaction on Solana's explorer or using the Solana CLI to see if the transaction would pass or fail without sending it from the wallet.

6. Handle Errors Gracefully
Add proper error handling in the executeFixedMultiHubSwap function to provide more information about the error, and attempt to retry the transaction if it's a transient issue.
