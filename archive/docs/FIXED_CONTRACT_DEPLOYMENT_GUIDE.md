# Updated Multihub Swap Contract - PDA Fix

This guide explains how to deploy the updated MultihubSwap contract that fixes the InvalidAccountData error.

## What Was Fixed

The "InvalidAccountData" error was caused by incorrect handling of the Program Authority PDA in the Rust program. The update:

1. ✅ **Fixes PDA Handling**: Now properly validates the Program Authority PDA by only checking that the key matches, without trying to deserialize its data.

2. ✅ **Adds Better Error Handling**: Improved token account unpacking with proper error messages.

3. ✅ **Includes Debug Logs**: Added detailed logging to help troubleshoot any PDA issues.

## Simple Deployment Steps

The easiest way to deploy the fixed contract is to use the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x deploy_fixed_multihub_swap.sh

# Run the deployment script
./deploy_fixed_multihub_swap.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build the updated contract
2. Deploy it to devnet
3. Generate a reference file with the Program ID

## After Deployment

After deploying the fixed contract, you need to:

1. Initialize the program using the admin panel
2. Fund the program with YOT and YOS tokens
3. Test with a small swap amount first

## Why This Fixes the Error

The bug was in how the program handled the Program Authority PDA. PDAs are special accounts that don't have private keys, so they shouldn't be treated like normal accounts.

The updated code properly uses the PDA only for signing transactions with `invoke_signed` and never tries to access its data directly, which was causing the "InvalidAccountData" error.

## Testing the Fix

Start with small swaps (0.001 SOL) before trying larger amounts. You should see the swap complete successfully without the InvalidAccountData error.
