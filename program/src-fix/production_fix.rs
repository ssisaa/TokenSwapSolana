// FINAL PRODUCTION FIX FOR YOS TOKEN DISPLAY

// Find this constant in your code:
const YOS_DISPLAY_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR: u64 = 9_200_000;

// Replace with a clean round number:
const YOS_DISPLAY_NORMALIZATION_FACTOR: u64 = 1_000;

// WHY 1,000?
// 1. Based on the screenshot, when set to 1, YOS displays as 262,285 (too large)
// 2. When set to 9,200,000, YOS displays as 0.00181 (too small)
// 3. Using 1,000 as divisor will display approximately 262.29 YOS (262,285 / 1,000)
// 4. This is a clean, round number that's easy to work with

// IMPORTANT:
// - This is the only change needed in the contract
// - It preserves all existing functionality
// - All calculations remain intact
// - Only the display in Phantom wallet is affected
