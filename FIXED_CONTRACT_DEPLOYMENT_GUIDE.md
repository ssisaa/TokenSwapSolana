# Fixed Contract Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the fixed version of the MultihubSwap contract that resolves the InvalidAccountData error.

## What Changed in This Fix

The root cause of the "InvalidAccountData" error was incorrect handling of the Program Authority PDA in the Rust program:

1. ✅ **Fixed PDA Handling**: The program now properly validates the Program Authority PDA by checking only the key matches, without attempting to deserialize any data from it.

2. ✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling for token account unpacking to provide more specific error messages.

3. ✅ **Added Debug Logging**: Added debug logs to help pinpoint issues with Program Authority PDA keys.

4. ✅ **Robust Token Account Access**: Added safer unpacking of token accounts with error handling.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Program

```bash
# Navigate to the program directory
cd program

# Build the program
cargo build-bpf

# The compiled program will be in target/deploy/
```

### 2. Deploy to Devnet

Use the Solana CLI to deploy the program:

```bash
# Upload the program to devnet (using your keypair)
solana program deploy --keypair path/to/keypair.json --program-id path/to/program-keypair.json target/deploy/multihub_swap.so --url devnet
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

Verify the program is correctly deployed:

```bash
# Check the program account
solana program show --keypair path/to/keypair.json <PROGRAM_ID> --url devnet
```

### 4. Update Client Code References

Make sure your client/frontend code is using the correct program ID. No other changes are needed to the client code as all fixes are on the program side.

## After Deployment

After deploying the fixed contract, you should:

1. Initialize the program (if it's a new program ID)
2. Fund the program with YOT and YOS tokens
3. Test a small swap (0.001 SOL) to verify functionality
4. Gradually test with larger amounts

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after deploying the fixed version:

1. Check the token accounts exist and are properly funded
2. Verify the Program Authority PDA has SOL (use the debug panel)
3. Make sure the user has token accounts for all involved tokens
4. Run a simulation before actual swap to debug issues

## Technical Details of the Fix

The key changes were:

1. Removed implicit deserialization of account data from the Program Authority PDA
2. Added proper error handling when unpacking token accounts
3. Added additional debug logging to verify account addresses match

This ensures that the Program Authority PDA is only used for signing transactions and never for storing/reading data.
